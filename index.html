<p id="Text">Hey<br>
You can leave now<br>
going beyond this point is stupid<br>
oh<br>
you're still here<br>
you'll find nothing<br>
you're just wasting your time<br>
did you lose you phone?<br>
did you look in your hand<br>
WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE<br>
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO SEE<br>
I'm telling you<br>
you're just wasting your time<br>
you could get laid right now<br>
but instead<br>
you're spending your time scrolling a page looking for nothing<br>
I said there's NOTHING here<br>
leave<br>
there isn't any puzzle for you to find<br>

you'll get 50 dollars if you leave<br>
